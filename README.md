# frontend.php
------------------------
This php file is the code running at front-end side. It is largely inherited
from the code
[here](https://github.com/photo/openphoto-php/blob/master/openphoto). It
realizes http requests redirecting by hard-coding different business logic IPs
and using different ones for different operations.
